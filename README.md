#Introduction
For this project, you will create a web application that allows users to view and manage their recent bank transactions. The app will fetch transaction data from a local server running JSON DB server and display it in a table. Users will also be able to add new transactions and filter transactions based on a search term.

#

#Core Deliverables
As a user, I can:

See a table of all transactions.
Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table (note: the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend).
Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
Bonus Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description.
Delete a transaction, which will remove it from the table.
